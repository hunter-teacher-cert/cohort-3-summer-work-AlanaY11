Chapter 7 Loops 
/*  Write a method called squareRoot that takes a double and returns an approximation of the square root of the parameter, using this technique. You should not use Math.sqrt.

As your initial guess, you should use a/2. Your method should iterate until it gets two consecutive estimates that differ by less than 0.0001. You can use Math.abs to 
 calculate the absolute value of the difference. 
*/

Exercise 1  
Consider the following methods:

public static void main(String[] args) {
    loop(10);
}

    public static double squareRoot(double n) {
        double sqroot = n / 2;
        double temp = 0;

        while (temp - sqroot != 0) {
            temp = sqroot;
            sqroot = (temp + (n / temp)) / 2;
        }
        return sqroot;
    }
  

Exercise 1 - Part1 - Draw a table that shows the value of the variables i and n during the execution of loop. The table should contain one column for each variable and one line for each iteration.
sqroot -   temp
5.0        5.0
3.5        3.5
3.17       3.17
3.16       3.16


Exercise 1 - Part 2 - What is the output of this program? 3.162277660168379

Exercise 1 - Part 3 - Can you prove that this loop terminates for any positive value of n?
