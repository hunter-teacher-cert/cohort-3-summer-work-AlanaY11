Assignment :: Create a livecoding plan of your own by annotating code.

Come up with TNPG.

Select a language to write a livecoding plan for.

Select a task to write a livecoding plan for (ideally, this would be a piece of code you have already available, it could even be sample code provided to you in the programming/data structures course)

Create your livecoding plan. You can use any combination of the TEACHER PROMPTS from the previous activity and your own reminders/symbols/notation.

DELIVERABLE: Submit your livecoding plan as methods/02_livecode_LANGUAGE with the appropriate file extension for your plan. If your group creates a plan that includes drawing markup, a pdf or image file is acceptable.
