  The teacher will be purposeful in the choices made for the conditional commands (getting to know your students) such that this game can be engaging while also informative to differentiate small groups for students who have misconceptions or are not able to demonstrate understanding consistently. IE:  
IF your first name starts with a ‘J’, THEN give me a thumbs up
IF your last name ends with a ‘Y’ or an ‘R’, THEN raise both your arms, ELSE Hand on your hips.
*While the statements below would only be informative if the teacher knows the responses.
IF you play soccer, THEN kick your feet (be careful not to kick anyone)
IF your favorite ice cream flavor is chocolate, THEN stick out your tongue, ELSE make rabbit ears behind your head
IF you play a musical instrument, THEN snap your fingers, ELSE whistle
IF your favorite monster in Minecraft is a zombie, THEN make zombie noises and movements, ELSE jump up and down

//Backgroud for Teacher but not 
Equity in CS/SEL: Gives the teacher an opportunity for an explicit example of Equity in CS. Discuss a safe environment that is fair and inclusive, using characteristics that are not harmful or demeaning to others. Especially, for students to keep this in mind as a condition when its their turn to write/add their own if then statements. It can also offer the opportunity to discuss audience when designing a game or program, mindful of accessibility, language, etc. and possible iterations or modifications to the game/program.
